                  strong Foodborne Illness &nbsp;
                  | (sometimes called "foodborne disease," "foodborne infection," or "food poisoning") is a common, costly—yet preventable—public health problem. Each year, 1 in 6 Americans gets sick by consuming contaminated foods or beverages. Many different disease-causing microbes, or pathogens, can contaminate foods, so there are many different foodborne infections. In addition, poisonous chemicals or other harmful substances can cause foodborne diseases if they are present in food.
              
                ul
                  li.faq
                    | More than 250 different foodborne diseases have been described. Most of these diseases are infections, caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can be foodborne.
                  li.faq
                    | Other diseases are poisonings, caused by harmful toxins or chemicals that have contaminated the food, for example, poisonous mushrooms.
                  li.faq
                    | These different diseases have many different symptoms, so there is no one "syndrome" that is foodborne illness. However, the microbe or toxin enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, and often causes the first symptoms there, so nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea are common symptoms in many foodborne diseases.
                p
                | Many microbes can spread in more than one way, so we cannot always know that a disease is foodborne. The distinction matters, because public health authorities need to know how a particular disease is spreading in order to take the appropriate steps to stop it. For example, 
                a(href='http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/index.html' target='_blank') Escherichia coliO157:H7 
                | infections can spread through contaminated food, contaminated drinking water, contaminated swimming water, and from toddler to toddler at a day care center. Depending on |which means of spread caused a case, the measures to stop other cases from occurring could range from removing contaminated food from stores, chlorinating a swimming pool, |or closing a child day care center.

                  | Many surveillance systems are used in the United States to provide information about the occurrence of foodborne disease. Most of CDC’s surveillance systems rely on data from state and local health agencies. Some focus on specific pathogens likely to be transmitted through food, and have been used extensively for decades. More recently, new surveillance methods have emerged which improve the quality, quantity, and timeliness of data (e.g., sentinel surveillance systems and national laboratory networks).

FoodNet conducts population-based surveillance for seven  bacterial and two parasitic infections transmitted commonly through food.

                  | CDC collects reports of foodborne outbreaks due to enteric bacterial, viral, parasitic, and chemical agents. State, local, and territorial public health agencies report these outbreaks through the 
                  Strong National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)
                  |. The NORS surveillance team conducts analyses of these data to improve understanding of the human health impact of foodborne outbreaks and the pathogens, foods, settings, and contributing factors involved in these outbreaks. Starting in 2009, the system has included modules for reporting enteric disease outbreaks transmitted through water, person-to-person contact, or direct contact with animals. The system that preceded NORS was called the electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (eFORS).

                  | Investigators from state and local public health agencies gather information about contributing factors in foodborne outbreaks through environmental assessments conducted by food control officials, and report the results to CDC. Contributing factors cannot be identified through general inspections of operating procedures or sanitary conditions, such as those used for licensing or routine inspection of a restaurant, but require a systematic description of what happened and how events most likely unfolded in an outbreak. CDC’s 
                  Strong EHS-Net 
                  |  was established in 2000 to address the environmental causes of foodborne disease.

                  | Participants include environmental health specialists and epidemiologists from 9 states, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Food Safety Inspection Service in the US Department of Agriculture (FSIS/USDA), and CDC. CDC has developed, through EHS-Net, an electronic reporting system for contributing factors and other root causes of foodborne outbreaks. In 2011, this EHS-Net activity will be launched nationally through the Conference for Food Protection as the National Voluntary Environmental Assessment Information System (NVEAIS), and participation will be open to any food regulatory program in the United States.
