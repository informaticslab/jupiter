									| visualization known as a

									| When you place your pointer on an entity outside the ring, you can automatically see the relationships which exist between the selected entity and other entities. The data is organized alphabetically only.

									| Because of the large amount of data displayed on the screen, this tool does run a bit slowly on laptops and desktops, and though it is able to run on tablet devices, its performance needs improvement.

The user can select a specific activity, and select specific related activity types (e.g., surveillance systems) - and then search for specific metadata (i.e., specific attributes within those related systems).  Examples of specific metadata include elements such as "report frequency," "data technology," or "operational status."
