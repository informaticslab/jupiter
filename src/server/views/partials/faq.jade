						Strong What is a Surveillance System?
				.answers
					| A surveillance system is an organized infrastructure that enables the ongoing systematic collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data, followed by their dissemination to those who need to know so they may:

						Strong What is a Program?
				.answers
					| A program is an organized set of projects and services intended to meet a public need. Programs often establish policy, and may develop and recommend interventions. Programs may manage surveillance systems and support tools and services, but for the purposes of the NBRHH, the unique value added by programs warrants a distinct category. Information about programs reflects the vital contributions program staff and resources make, irrespective of whether they 
					em own
					|  particular surveillance systems or use particular surveillance tools. CDC Emerging Infections Program (EIP) is an example of a program.

						Strong What is a Collaborative?
				.answers
					| A collaborative is an entity in which two or more organizations join and work together, share knowledge and expertise, and build consensus toward meeting common goals. The Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN) is an example of a collaborative. An advisory committee, such as the National Biosurveillance Advisory Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Advisory Committee to the CDC Director, is also an example of a collaborative.

						Strong What is a Tool?
				.answers
					| A tool is an application that supports surveillance by enabling a very specific task (e.g., message transport, data transformation, communications, identity management). Tools differ from systems mainly in size, complexity, and the number of functions they support. A system can be comprised of multiple tools to meet a function or business need. In the context of the NBRHH, a tool is an application that provides targeted functionality which can be used independently or by a system. The Public Health Information Network Messaging System (PHIN MS) is an example of a tool.

						Strong What is a Surveillance Registry?
				.answers
					| Surveillance registries often provide longitudinal data and include numerous events observed across the 
					em life 
					|  or duration of a case. A registry can provide measures of incidence of an event, information about progression of disease, or potential subjects for epidemiologic studies. Registries can be public health surveillance systems if they are conducted in an ongoing systematic way, analyzed routinely, used for planning and implementation of public health practice, and integrated with timely dissemination of information applied to disease prevention and health promotion.

						Strong What is a Health Survey?
				.answers
					| Surveys offer a mechanism to measure, sometimes at repeated or regular intervals, indicators of health on a statistically selected sample so information can be generalized to entire populations.  These health indicators can be tracked over time, supplying important information about trends in health, but such surveys are not associated directly with planning, implementing, and evaluation of public health practice.  Often these indicators provide baseline measures used to compare results of public health surveillance, registries, environmental monitoring, or research studies.
